To run the code using {\ttfamily  mpirun }, use the following command \-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ mpirun -n process\_number code\_path -f input\_file 
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item process\-\_\-number \-: The number of processes to run.
\item code\-\_\-path \-: The path to your executable code.
\item input\-\_\-file \-: The input file required for the code to run. (input file should be {\ttfamily .json} file)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries  Example $<${\bfseries } $>$}

{\bfseries 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ mpirun -n 4 /usr/local/bin/mycode -f data/input.json

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item -\/h \-: Help option
\item -\/f \-: \hyperlink{InputFile}{Input file} option (Required) (See \hyperlink{InputFile}{Input file})
\item -\/m \-: Method (See method)
\item -\/q \-: Quantity (See quantity)
\item -\/\-I \-: File path to set the position of bath spins (See bathfiles)
\item -\/s \-: File path to set the spin state of bath spins (See statefile)
\item -\/a \-: File path to set principal axies of the defects in the bath (See avaaxfile)
\item -\/\-S \-: File path to set the spin state of on-\/site spins of the defects in the bath (See exstatefile) 
\item -\/\-N \-: The number of state configuration to do time ensemble average (See nstate)
\item -\/\-B \-: Magnetic field in z direction (Unit \-: G) (See bfield)
\item -\/o \-: Result file path (See output)
